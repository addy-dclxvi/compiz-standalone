# Compiz Standalone Session
Just a helper for running Compiz session without a full desktop environment. I include compiz.dekstop file to make Compiz session appears in your login manager. And a startup file in ~/.config/compiz-1 to make your life easier. And don't forget, at first time You login You will get a blank page. Use Alt+F2 to run gmrun, then edit your ~/.config/compiz-1/autostart file. At last, Maybe this package is useless :D
## Requirement
Please install 'compiz & 'emerald' packages first from AUR
